(* After all the binding structure has been resolved we have this
 * morhpism which validates that each [CUST] is actually valid. That is
 * that each [CUST (id, symbs, arity)] refers to an operator which
 *  - Exists in the signature before its occurence
 *  - Actually has the arity we claim it does
 * However beyond that this pass doesn't actually modify anything
 *
 * NOTE: This pass doesn't really comport with the formalized elaboration
 * semantics for signatures. This is because in our semantics, custom operators
 * don't carry around their arities. However, due to the way that the abstract
 * binding tree logical framework is implemented, we must specify our operators
 * statically, and so it is necessary for members of family of operators of
 * varying arity to carry their arities.
